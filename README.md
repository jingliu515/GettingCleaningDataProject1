## INSTRUCTIONS

There are four files in the repo.

* a tidy data file named ```summaryData.txt```
* an R code file named ```run_analysis.R```
* a code book named ```CodeBook.md```
* and a ```README.md``` file

The ```run_analysis.R``` file is the R code used to read and clean data, giving the ```summaryData.txt``` tidy data.

The ```CodeBook.md``` file describes the data, steps of data cleaning, and variables in the resulting tidy data set.
